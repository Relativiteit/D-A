# D&A
I am a software engineer since the end of 2020? And it's about time I git good.
There is simply no excape to D&A and if you want to build fast products you need D&A. 
So one way or another it's going down. 


## Way of working
To keep things easy I will just go through 2 or maybe 3 books if needed.

The first book is `grokking algorithms, an illustrated guideforprogrammers andothercurious people`

The next books is `crls` the t h i c c book. Have it since 2022 it's about time I read more then the first 50 pages.


# Introduction to algorithms
A introductionary book to algorithms, simple and effective in giving you a intuition of algorithms with good visuals.
For a engineer like me who is schooled in mechanical engineering these type of books are gold. 
It gives me a tangible idea of how data gets stored in memory and the difference how a linkedlist does this instead of a array. So 10/10 book if you already kinda know how to program and need to a starter on algorthms. 

## Binary search

## Big O notation
